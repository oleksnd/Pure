# PURE — Encyclopedia of Color

**PURE** is a high-end, standalone web application and interactive guide dedicated to the psychology, physiology, and design principles of color. Built with a "Zero-Bloat" philosophy, it provides designers, artists, and psychologists with a deep-dive matrix of color perception.

## 🌟 Core Concept

The project aims to map the invisible threads between wavelength and emotion. It moves beyond simple "color meanings" into the territory of neurophysiology, cultural archetypes, and compositional mathematics. All logic is encapsulated in a single, high-performance file.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Perception Matrix
An interactive 9x9 grid that provides instant psychological profiling for base colors and their specific shades. Choose a color to see its:
- **Psychological Profile:** The emotional core of the color.
- **Physical & Physiological Properties:** How it affects heart rate (HRV) and cognitive load.
- **Master's Advice:** When to use it and how it behaves in a composition.
- **Best Pairings:** Scientifically and aesthetically proven combinations.

### 2. Emotion Palettes
A library of "Color Strategies" designed to construct specific emotional environments:
- **Nostalgia:** Faded, low-saturation tones.
- **Serenity:** Parasympathetic-activating blues and greens.
- **Power:** High-dominance emeralds and golds.
- **Triumph:** Maximum arousal warm spectrums.

### 3. Design Formulas & Rules
Visualized guides for perfect balance:
- **60-30-10 Rule:** The golden ratio of harmony.
- **The Minimalist:** Absolute accent in a void.
- **The Duel:** Constructing tension through opposition.
- **The Monolith:** Total immersion in a single state.

### 4. Advanced Principles
- **Geometric Resonance:** How shapes (triangles/circles) amplify color impact (based on Kandinsky's theories).
- **Neural Opponency:** Using Hering's theory for physiological balance.
- **Circadian Validity:** Adjusting palettes for light spectrums and time of day.

### 5. Research & Data
A dedicated section for neurophysiological facts, covering:
- **Chromostereopsis:** The physics of "Push & Pull" in visual depth.
- **Memory Recall:** The 60% boost in retention through strategic color use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since the project is a standalone web application, you can run it by simply opening `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome is recommended for full Prompt API support) or use links.
